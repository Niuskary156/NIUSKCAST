    <h1>About EcoTesla</h1>
    <p>This project was created by <strong>Niuskary Salazar</strong> as part of a web development assignment.</p>
    <p>EcoTesla demonstrates the use of HTML, CSS, and PHP in a functional web application that calculates energy costs and environmental benefits of electric vehicles. With EcoTesla, my goal is two fold: to showcase my technical skills in building dynamic web applications, and to raise awareness about clean energy and sustainable transportation choices. Through a clean design and user-friendly interface, I aim to inspire visitors to explore eco-conscious alternatives that contribute to a more responsible future. </p>
    <p>The goal of this project is to promote clean energy and awareness of sustainable driving choices.</p>
